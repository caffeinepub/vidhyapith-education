  "summary": "Hero and header were redesigned with updated copy and polished styling, preserving fixed header behavior, navigation targets, and smooth scrolling. However, the hero copy does not use the requested “Open/Distance” and “Online mode” phrasing exactly, and the diff includes broader global theme/styling changes beyond the header/hero scope.",

      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Hero messaging must clearly state courses are available in “Open/Distance” mode and “Online” mode across Chhattisgarh, using correct English spelling/grammar (examples include “Open/Distance”, “Online”, “Chhattisgarh”).",
      "reason": "The hero includes badges reading “Open & Distance Learning” and “Online Courses” rather than explicitly stating “Open/Distance mode” and “Online mode” as requested in the requirement/AC examples. While the meaning is similar, the specified wording is not present in the shown diff excerpt.",

      "requirement": "Hero section styling must be updated without removing the existing CTAs.",
