# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the header + home hero area and update the hero copy to clearly communicate course availability in Open/Distance and Online modes across Chhattisgarh.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the home hero messaging to correct English and explicitly state course availability in “Open/Distance” and “Online” modes across Chhattisgarh.
- Redesign the upper section (fixed header + hero) with a more polished layout (typography/spacing/composition) while keeping the existing navigation targets (Home/Services/Streams/About/Contact), responsiveness, smooth scroll behavior, and existing CTAs intact.
- Ensure the refreshed design remains consistent with the current site design system and does not introduce blue/purple as the primary palette.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a more polished header/hero area with clear, correctly written messaging that courses are available in Open/Distance and Online modes across Chhattisgarh, and navigation/CTAs work as before on desktop and mobile.
